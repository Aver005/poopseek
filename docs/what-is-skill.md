## What are Agent Skills?

Agent skills are reusable instruction sets that extend your coding agent's capabilities. They're defined in `SKILL.md`
files with YAML frontmatter containing a `name` and `description`.

Skills let agents perform specialized tasks like:

- Generating release notes from git history
- Creating PRs following your team's conventions
- Integrating with external tools (Linear, Notion, etc.)

Discover skills at **[skills.sh](https://skills.sh)**

## Supported Agents

Skills can be installed to any of these agents:

<!-- supported-agents:end -->

> [!NOTE]
> **Kiro CLI users:** After installing skills, manually add them to your custom agent's `resources` in
> `.kiro/agents/<agent>.json`:
>
> ```json
> {
>   "resources": ["skill://.kiro/skills/**/SKILL.md"]
> }
> ```

The CLI automatically detects which coding agents you have installed. If none are detected, you'll be prompted to select
which agents to install to.

## Creating Skills

Skills are directories containing a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: What this skill does and when to use it
---

# My Skill

Instructions for the agent to follow when this skill is activated.

## When to Use

Describe the scenarios where this skill should be used.

## Steps

1. First, do this
2. Then, do that
```

### Required Fields

- `name`: Unique identifier (lowercase, hyphens allowed)
- `description`: Brief explanation of what the skill does

### Optional Fields

- `metadata.internal`: Set to `true` to hide the skill from normal discovery. Internal skills are only visible and
  installable when `INSTALL_INTERNAL_SKILLS=1` is set. Useful for work-in-progress skills or skills meant only for
  internal tooling.

```markdown
---
name: my-internal-skill
description: An internal skill not shown by default
metadata:
  internal: true
---
```

### Skill Discovery

The CLI searches for skills in these locations within a repository:

<!-- skill-discovery:start -->
- Root directory (if it contains `SKILL.md`)
- `skills/`
- `skills/.curated/`
- `skills/.experimental/`
- `skills/.system/`
- `.agents/skills/`
- `.augment/skills/`
- `.claude/skills/`
- `./skills/`
- `.codebuddy/skills/`
- `.commandcode/skills/`
- `.continue/skills/`
- `.cortex/skills/`
- `.crush/skills/`
- `.factory/skills/`
- `.goose/skills/`
- `.junie/skills/`
- `.iflow/skills/`
- `.kilocode/skills/`
- `.kiro/skills/`
- `.kode/skills/`
- `.mcpjam/skills/`
- `.vibe/skills/`
- `.mux/skills/`
- `.openhands/skills/`
- `.pi/skills/`
- `.qoder/skills/`
- `.qwen/skills/`
- `.roo/skills/`
- `.trae/skills/`
- `.windsurf/skills/`
- `.zencoder/skills/`
- `.neovate/skills/`
- `.pochi/skills/`
- `.adal/skills/`
<!-- skill-discovery:end -->

### Plugin Manifest Discovery

If `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` or `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` exists, skills declared in those files are also discovered:

```json
// .claude-plugin/marketplace.json
{
  "metadata": { "pluginRoot": "./plugins" },
  "plugins": [
    {
      "name": "my-plugin",
      "source": "my-plugin",
      "skills": ["./skills/review", "./skills/test"]
    }
  ]
}
```

This enables compatibility with the [Claude Code plugin marketplace](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugin-marketplaces) ecosystem.

If no skills are found in standard locations, a recursive search is performed.

## Compatibility

Skills are generally compatible across agents since they follow a
shared [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io). However, some features may be agent-specific:
